The Flow is the app I built to track my expenses.
I plan to write a full post about how I built it - why I made it, explain some of the tech & product decisions, and share the lessones learned along the way.

In the meantime, I want to emphasize on one thing in particular - **Migrations**.

I believe great developers are ones that are good with migrations, so while building "The Flow" I intentionally chose to implement the app in a way that I'll migrate parts of it (e.g - implement navigation myself, without react-router).
This way, I also purify the value proposition of each individual library, while also aiming for code that is optimized for change, thus, getting better at migrations.

This is the current list of migrations I plan to implement:

- **typescript** for static type checking
- **react-router** for routing
- **react-query/swr** for server state
- **reach-ui/spectrum/chakra/headless-ui/tailwind-ui-react** as a component library
- **zuzstand** for client state

And one more thing, here's a another sneak peek to the app:
