==Intro==

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

## What are we optimizing for?

- Bug-O over Big-O
- Reducing Complexity
- Local Reasoning

(Excalidraw chart?)

Perhaps run time or memory requirements, also known as Big-O?
let me suggest a different one, Bug-O.

Quoting from [Dan Abramov](https://mobile.twitter.com/dan_abramov)'s [fantastic post](https://overreacted.io/the-bug-o-notation/):

> The Big-O describes how much an algorithm slows down as the inputs grow.

> The Bug-O describes how much an API slows you down as your codebase grows.

## Solutions and Trade-offs

refactoring from the naive approach to the good one.
- Naive Approach
- With conditional's reorder
- With early returns

Local Reasoning -> with early returns and conditionals order.

Other options are HashMap (stringToReturn = getStringFromMap(map)), String Concatenation and The One Liner (and Ben's youtube thing?)

I would use those if bla bla (more variants? "FizzBuzzFooBoo").

- Something about branching order that matters ("The different in complexity boils down two one principle - order of branches");

## UI States and Writing Better React Components

The TL;DR:

- Local Reasoning -> with early returns and conditionals order
- Bridging the gap between design and code -> by mapping conditionals and components to ui states

the state of an app mapped to the corresponding condition:

1. Loading -> !data && !error
2. Error -> error
3. Empty -> data.length === 0 && !error
4. Content -> data.length > 0 && !error

== Code example from a real react component ==
Bonus - avoid the conditional hooks bug by extracting to a component
